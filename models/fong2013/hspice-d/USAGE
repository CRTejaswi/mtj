To use the NRL SPICE MTJ libraries, please extract the
NRL_SPICE_MTJ_LIB_stable*.tgz file. Include the
NRL_MTJ_SPICE_ENC_LIB.inc from the set of extracted
files at the beginning of your SPICE deck.

** All units are in S.I. unless stated otherwise. **

**** Available MTJ models:
1) PMAMTJ
2) IMAMTJ

**** Example line to instantiate the model in your netlist:

X* node1 node2 node3 node4 node5 *MTJ
+ W='width' L='length' Tm='t_FL' TMgO='TMgO'
+ alpha='damping' Ms='Msat' Ku2='Ku2'
+ th_hard='th_hard' phi_hard='phi_hard'
+ LLG_Temp='Temperature' mu_r_therm='mu_r_therm'
+ thermScale='therm_scale'

- node1 is the node name for the free layer of the MTJ

- node2 is the node name for the hard layer of the MTJ

- Voltages of node3, node4, and node5 represent the
  x, y, and z-components of the applied magnetic field
  on the free layer (in CGS units), respectively.


**** Model parameters:
- Parameters inherited from OOMMF: P_L, P_R, Lambda_L,
  Lambda_R, eps_prime. Please refer to OOMMF user
  manual regarding these parameters

- W: width of MTJ (in m)

- L: length of MTJ (in m)

- Tm: thickness of free layer (in m)

- TMgO: thickness of tunneling oxide layer (in nm)

- alpha: Damping constant in Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
  equation (LLG)

- Ms: saturation magnetization of free layer (in emu/cm^3)

- Ku2: uniaxial anisotropy constant (in erg/cm^3)

- th_hard, phi_hard: vector direction of hard layer
  defined in spherical coordinates (in radians)

- LLG_Temp: Absolute temperature of free layer for
  stochastic LLG (sLLG) simulations (in Kelvin)

- mu_r_therm: scaling factor for controlling thermal
  fluctuations in sLLG simulations. The variance of
  the thermal fluctuation term scales as
  1.0 / mu_r_therm (unitless)

- thermScale: scaling term to multiply to thermal
  fluctuation. Set to '0.0' for zero temperature (unitless)

**** Additional notes:

- Internal nodes for debugging:
  1) MTJ_curr: the voltage corresponds to the current (in Amperes)
     flowing from free to pinned layer of MTJ
  2) th, phi: the magnetization direction of the MTJ
     free layer in spherical coordinates (in radians).
  3) MX, MY, MZ: the magnetization direction of the
     MTJ free layer in Cartesian coordinates.

- Initialization:
  1) To set the initial magnetization direction of the
     MTJ free layer, use the lines:
     .ic V(X*.XLLG_Eq.thInt)='theta_init'
     .ic V(X*.XLLG_Eq.phiInt)='phi_init'
     where X* is the instance name of the MTJ in your
     netlist, and theta_init and phi_init are the
     spherical coordinates of the initial
     magnetization of the free layer (in radians)
